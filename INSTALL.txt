Here's some instructions on how to build and install libgpif.

1. Create Makefiles (cmake needed)
    
    If you want to install into a non-standard location you can modify the
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake cache entry to change the destination using the
    following cmake parameter:

        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/libgpif

    You might want to tell cmake if you'd like to build tests or not. You will
    need to have cunit (http://cunit.sourceforge.net/) installed in order to use
    this, otherwise your build will fail:

        -DGPIF_WITH_TESTS:BOOL=TRUE

    I would suggest building out of tree, so make yourself a build directory
    somewhere:

        mkdir build
        cd build

    Finally run cmake with any of the above options. I prefixed the cmake
    command with the CFLAGS that I wanted to use, you will probably want to use
    your own ones. If in doubt just omit any CFLAGS.

        CFLAGS="-march=nocona -O2 -pipe -Wall -Werror" cmake [OPTS] /path/to/libgpif/src/

2. Build
    
        make

    Running make in your build directory will build the shared libgpif library
    and optionally a 'gpiftest' binary which runs some unit tests on the library:

3. Install

        make install

    There is no need to install if for instance you just want to run gpiftest.
    cmake will set everything up accordingly. Just go ahead and run test/piftest
    from the build direcotry. I would suggest to do so before installing anyway.
